# Supercomputer , origin and the path


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supercomputers are the best performing computers of the humankind technology history till today. 
The hardware, size,technology base, power and even budgets have been changed dramatically. They were designed to solve grand scale technical and scientific challenge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a general understanding of super computer history, The Control Data Corporation 6600 was the world's first supercomputer, which is designed by Seymour Cray and James E. Thorton.
In technical perspective, The 6600 had 60 bit words with 18 bit addresses, for a potential of 256k words of memory.
It processed 10 million instructions per second, awesome speed for 1964. 
The famous programming language Pascal was created on the CDC 6000 series at Zurich that decade.
