# Supercomputer , origin and the path


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supercomputers are the best performing computers of the humankind technology history till today. 
The hardware, size,technology base, power and even budgets have been changed dramatically. They were designed to solve grand scale technical and scientific challenge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a general understanding of super computer history, The Control Data Corporation 6600 was the world's first supercomputer, 
which is designed by Seymour Cray and James E. Thorton.
In technical perspective, The 6600 had 60 bit words with 18 bit addresses, for a potential of 256k words of memory.
It processed 10 million instructions per second, awesome speed for 1964. 
The famous programming language Pascal was created on the CDC 6000 series at Zurich that decade.
The console screens were calligraphic, not raster based. Analog circuitry actually steered the electron beams to draw the individual characters on the screen.(Ref#2)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 30 years, the timeline comes to 1987, the milestone called nCUBE achieves 548 speedup compare to the past generation: 
the 32-bit CMOS processor containing 160000 transistors and on a frequence of 8MHz work with its own 128KB ECC DRAm provides the ability to win first Bell Prize, 
stimulated Gustafson’s Law of Scalable Speed-Up, Amdahl’s Law Corollary.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To most recent, Th1A(Tianhe-1A) built in 2010s for 186368 core staged super computer was built and race to the world's fastest supercomputer 
that time with a peak computing rate of 2.57 petaFLOPS.The supercomputer came with 14336 Xeon X5670 processors and 7168 Nvidia Tesla M2050 GPU, 2048 FeiTeng 1000 sub processors and 5PB storage.
The power can be commonly 4.04 megawatts and max with gpu to reach 12 megawatts.
