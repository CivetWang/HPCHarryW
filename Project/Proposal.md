# Meta transaction data analysis and classifier

<p>One of the data has been found is about transaction and features about them. 
The security problem of nowadays is a major point paople may focus and worry about.
The data source from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vardhansiramdasu/fraudulent-transactions-prediction 
provides a Fraudulent Transactions Prediction base for Machine Learning need.
</p>

<p> As all statistical analysis, the ideal analysis flow would start with an EDA and 
investigation of approach which would be best fit path towards the model. The pre-validation would cluster 
the different groups and feature slection would perform the majority of the analysis.
</p>

<p>As what I have been learning for the past two terms,R and Python would be the most used productity and needed modules in HPC.
To be specific, if the approach is made in Python, modules like Numpy ,scipy, matplotlab and sklearn would be the basic modules would required.
At the same time, Caret,kernLab, mlr3S, uperml and e1071 would be the most 5 packages used in R side.
</p>

<p>From this point, as there wasn't too much learning depth in HPC, I would not able to purpose a lot about performance optimization targets.
 But I'll update the targets as the progress through the project.</p>
